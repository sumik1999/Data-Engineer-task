Settled life, which involves the transition from foraging to farming and pastoralism, began in South Asia around 7,000 BCE.  At the site of Mehrgarh presence can be documented of the domestication of wheat and barley, rapidly followed by that of goats, sheep, and cattle.[2] By 4,500 BCE, settled life had spread more widely,[2] and began to gradually evolve into the Indus Valley Civilization, an early civilization of the Old world, which was contemporaneous with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. This civilisation flourished between 2,500 BCE and 1900 BCE in what today is Pakistan and north-western India, and was noted for its urban planning, baked brick houses, elaborate drainage, and water supply.[3]\n"

It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India,[a][8][b][9] though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east.[c][10] The rebellion posed a considerable threat to British power in that region,[d][11] and was contained only with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858.[12] On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859. Its name is contested, and it is variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and the First War of Independence.[e][13]\n"

The Oxford English Dictionary, for example, gives three possibilities: \"Of mixed British and Indian parentage, of Indian descent but born or living in Britain or (chiefly historical) of English descent or birth but living or having lived long in India\".[7] People fitting the middle definition are more usually known as British Asian or British Indian. This article focuses primarily on the modern definition, a distinct minority community of mixed Eurasian ancestry, whose first language is English. According to the Indian government , one is considered an Anglo-Indian if he or she has an British ancestor in paternal line. As the term Euro-Indians would be confused with Indo-Europeans, the group now also includes Hispano-Indians, those who have a Portuguese ancestor in paternal line, therefore the Anglo-Indians can have  either an Iberian or a British surname. The early wave of Greek settlers after Alexanders' conquest are wholly assimilated, so there are no Greek-Indians anymore.  \n"

It fought alongside Japanese soldiers in the latter's campaign in the Southeast Asian theatre of WWII.[1] The army was first formed in 1942 under Captain Mohan Singh by Indian PoWs of the British-Indian Army captured by Japan in the Malayan campaign and at Singapore.[2] This first INA,which had been handed over to Rash Behari Bose, collapsed and was disbanded in December that year after differences between the INA leadership and the Japanese military over its role in Japan's war in Asia. Rash Behari Bose handed over INA to Subhas Chandra Bose.[3] It was revived under the leadership of Subhas Chandra Bose after his arrival in Southeast Asia in 1943. The army was declared to be the army of Bose's Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind (the Provisional Government of Free India).[4] Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose named the brigades/regiments of INA after Gandhi, Nehru, Maulana Azad, and himself.[5] There was also an all-women regiment named after Rani of Jhanshi, Lakshmibai. Under Bose's leadership, the INA drew ex-prisoners and thousands of civilian volunteers from the Indian expatriate population in Malaya (present-day Malaysia) and Burma.[6] This second INA fought along with the Imperial Japanese Army against the British and Commonwealth forces in the campaigns in Burma: at Imphal and Kohima, and later against the Allied retaking of Burma.[7][8]\n"

    "paragraph": "The partition of India was the division of British India[c] in 1947 into two independent Dominions: India and Pakistan.[6] The Dominion of India is today the Republic of India, and the Dominion of Pakistan is the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the People's Republic of Bangladesh. The partition involved the division of two provinces, Bengal and Punjab, based on district-wide non-Muslim or Muslim majorities. The partition also saw the division of the British Indian Army, the Royal Indian Navy, the Royal Indian Air Force, the Indian Civil Service, the railways, and the central treasury. The partition was outlined in the Indian Independence Act 1947 and resulted in the dissolution of the British Raj, i.e. Crown rule in India. The two self-governing independent Dominions of India and Pakistan legally came into existence at midnight on 15 August 1947.\n"

    "paragraph": "The monsoon of South Asia is among several geographically distributed global monsoons. It affects the Indian subcontinent, where it is one of the oldest and most anticipated weather phenomena and an economically important pattern every year from June through September, but it is only partly understood and notoriously difficult to predict. Several theories have been proposed to explain the origin, process, strength, variability, distribution, and general vagaries of the monsoon, but understanding and predictability are still evolving.\n"
