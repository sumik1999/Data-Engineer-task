Settled life, which involves the transition from foraging to farming and pastoralism, began in South Asia around 7,000 BCE.  At the site of Mehrgarh presence can be documented of the domestication of wheat and barley, rapidly followed by that of goats, sheep, and cattle.[2] By 4,500 BCE, settled life had spread more widely,[2] and began to gradually evolve into the Indus Valley Civilization, an early civilization of the Old world, which was contemporaneous with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. This civilisation flourished between 2,500 BCE and 1900 BCE in what today is Pakistan and north-western India, and was noted for its urban planning, baked brick houses, elaborate drainage, and water supply.[3]\n"

It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India,[a][8][b][9] though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east.[c][10] The rebellion posed a considerable threat to British power in that region,[d][11] and was contained only with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858.[12] On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859. Its name is contested, and it is variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and the First War of Independence.[e][13]\n"

This article focuses primarily on the modern definition, a distinct minority community of mixed Eurasian ancestry, whose first language is English. According to the Indian government , one is considered an Anglo-Indian if he or she has an British ancestor in paternal line. As the term Euro-Indians would be confused with Indo-Europeans, the group now also includes Hispano-Indians, those who have a Portuguese ancestor in paternal line, therefore the Anglo-Indians can have  either an Iberian or a British surname. The early wave of Greek settlers after Alexanders' conquest are wholly assimilated, so there are no Greek-Indians anymore.  \n"

In the process, these schools denigrated Native American culture and made children give up their languages and religion.[1] At the same time the schools provided a basic Western education. These boarding schools were first established by Christian missionaries of various denominations. The missionaries were often approved by the federal government to start both missions and schools on reservations,[2] especially in the lightly populated areas of the West. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries especially, the government paid religious orders to provide basic education to Native American children on reservations, and later established its own schools on reservations. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) also founded additional off-reservation boarding schools based on the assimilation model. These sometimes drew children from a variety of tribes. In addition, religious orders established off-reservation schools.\n"

        "paragraph": "Plains Indians or Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains and Canadian Prairies are the Native American tribes and First Nation band governments who have historically lived on the Interior Plains (the Great Plains and Canadian Prairies) of North America. While hunting-farming cultures have lived on the Great Plains for centuries prior to European contact, the region is known for the horse cultures that flourished from the 17th century through the late 19th century. Their historic nomadism and armed resistance to domination by the government and military forces of Canada and the United States have made the Plains Indian culture groups an archetype in literature and art for Native Americans everywhere.\n"
